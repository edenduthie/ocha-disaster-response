This chapter describes some of the most important international tools and services
available for disaster response in Asia and the Pacific.
</p>
<p>
As previously explained, the primary responders in any emergency are disasteraffected
communities and their Governments. International tools and services are only
activated when disaster response needs exceed national capacities and an affected
Government requests and/or accepts international assistance.

<a name="Urban Search and Rescue teams">Urban Search and Rescue teams</a> are composed of trained experts who provide
rescue and medical assistance in an emergency. USAR teams that deploy internationally
generally comprise expert personnel, specialized equipment and search dogs. They
can be operational within 24 to 48 hours of a disaster. USAR teams are offered and
received bilaterally and/or with the coordination support of the OCHA-managed
International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG). The advantage of working
with INSARAG to receive international USAR teams is that their precise capacities and
capabilities are specified through an INSARAG External Classification (IEC) and the
teams work according to internationally-agreed standards and modalities.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there are two complementary coordination mechanisms that support
INSARAG's USAR deployments:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vosocc.unocha.org/">Virtual On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (Virtual OSOCC)</a> is a global
online network and information portal that facilitates data exchange between disaster
responders and affected counties before, during and after sudden-onset disasters. It is
the first place to look to see if a Government is requesting search-and-rescue support,
and to track the arrival and position of different USAR teams.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.unocha.org/what-we-do/coordination-tools/osocc-rdc/overview">On-Site Operations Coordination Center (OSOCC)</a> is a physical facility established
in the USAR-requesting country to receive incoming and support inter-USAR
coordination. At the OSOCC, international relief teams are registered and receive
basic information about the situation, the operations of national and international
responders, and logistical arrangements.

Governments to make an initial assessment of needs for contributions to the affected
Government and/or to UN agencies, the RCRC Movement, and NGOs. Some key
bilateral technical response teams active in Asia and the Pacific include the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID)'s Disaster Assistance Response

<h4>
	<!--<i class="icon-book"></i>--> What is the difference between "light", "medium" and "heavy" USAR teams?
</h4>
<p>
According to INSARAG's classification system, USAR teams are classified in three
categories: light, medium and heavy.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Light USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to assist with surface
search and rescue in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Light USAR teams
are not normally recommended for international deployment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medium USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to conduct technical
search-and-rescue operations in structural-collapse incidents. Medium
USAR teams are required to be able to search for trapped people.
International Medium USAR teams travelling to an affected country should
be operational in the affected country within 32 hours of when the disaster
was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A medium team must be adequately
staffed to allow for 24-hour operations at one site for up to seven days.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Heavy USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability for difficult and
complex technical search-and-rescue operations. Heavy USAR teams are
required to be able to search for trapped people and use canine and technical
systems. They are also required to provide international assistance in disasters
resulting in the collapse of multiple structures, typically in urban settings,
when national response capacity has either been overwhelmed or does not
have the required capability. International heavy USAR teams travelling to an
affected country should be operational in the affected country within 48
hours of when the disaster was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A heavy team
must be adequately resourced to allow for 24-hour operations at two
separate sites for up to 10 days.

specially-trained international disaster management professionals from UN Member
States, UN agencies and other disaster response organizations that can be deployed
within 12 to 48 hours of a disaster. The primary elements of the UNDAC mandate
are assessment, coordination and information management. UNDAC teams are self-sufficient

<p>
Following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the Government of Japan requested
a specialized UNDAC team even though it did not request more general international
assistance.
</p>
<p>
Deployed within 48 hours, the seven-member UNDAC team provided emergency
support operations based out of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) office in Tokyo over a period of 10 days. The UNDAC team's terms of reference
requested by the Government of Japan were as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>To report to the international community on the emergency situation.</li>
<li>To advise the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on how to respond to the

<h4>
	<!--<i class="icon-book"></i>--> How can Governments manage international technical team deployment?
</h4>
<p>
One of the main challenges for disaster-affected Governments in the
initial hours and days of an emergency is managing numerous offers of
assistance, including offers to deploy USAR and other technical response
teams. In the midst of a crisis, it can be difficult for Governments to
evaluate what is and is not required. It can also be difficult to say turn
down offers of assistance.
</p>
<p>
It is important for states to remember that while "medium" and "heavy"
USAR teams can be critical to search and rescue in larger-scale disasters,
"light" teams are generally responsible for the highest percentage of livesaving
activities in an emergency. This is because, light teams are locally
based and they can immediately start operating when the disaster strikes.
Generally speaking, international USAR teams ("medium" and "heavy"
teams) should only be accepted if they can be operational within 36 hours
of a disaster, which is the critical window within which most lives can
actually be saved.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, it is important for national Governments to think ahead
about the types of disaster risk they face and evaluate the types of technical
assistance they might wish to accept as a result, from whom and in what
order of priority. Some teams can be requested to arrive in anticipation of
an expected need, for example if it is known that there will be a typhoon
affecting a certain area or population.
</p>
<p>
It can also be useful for Governments to request UNDAC (or ASEAN ERAT)
teams to manage the process of accepting or declining international offers
of assistance on their behalf. In that way, Government officials can focus
on delivering assistance to affected people through the national response
resources.
</p>
</div><!--/well-->
<div class="well well-warning">
<h4>REMEMBER</h4>
<p>

<a name="Military and Civil Defence Assets">Military and Civil-Defence Assets (MCDA)</a> are uniformed assets and services
contributed by foreign military and civil-defence organizations for humanitarian
assistance. They include relief personnel, equipment (e.g. air, ground and sea transport,
communication equipment), and supplies and services (e.g. medical support, security
services). MCDA are provided at no cost to the affected State and/or to the United
Nations, unless otherwise regulated by international agreement.
</p>
<p>
MCDA that are deployed through a central request to support UN agencies are called UN
MCDA. MCDA and UN MCDA are governed by individual Status of Forces Agreements
between two countries and/or by the <i>Oslo Guidelines on the Use of Foreign Military
and Civil Defence Assets in Disaster Relief</i>.

<h4>
	<!--<i class="icon-book"></i>--> The Use of Military Assets in Disasters in Asia and the Pacific : some key principles

<p>
MCDA should be seen as tools that complement existing relief mechanisms in
response to the humanitarian gap between the needs that the relief community is
being asked to satisfy and the resources available to meet them.
</p>
<p>
MCDA can be mobilized and deployed bilaterally or under regional or international
alliance agreements as "other deployed forces" or as part of a United Nations
operation as "UN MCDA". All disaster relief, including MCDA, should be provided at
the request or with the consent of the affected State and, in principle, on the basis of
an appeal for international assistance.
</p>
<p>
An assisting State deciding to employ its MCDA should bear in mind the cost/benefit
ratio of such operations as compared with other alternatives, if available. In principle,
MCDA should be requested only as a last resort, and the costs involved in using
MCDA on disaster relief missions abroad should not be diverted from those available
for international relief and development activities.<sup class="pop" data-toggle="popover" data-content="As noted in the Oslo Guidelines and APC-MADRO.">20</sup>

<a href="http://www.ihp.nu/" name="International Humanitarian Partnership">International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP)</a> is an informal network of seven
governmental organisations in Europe working in support of emergency operations
on a daily basis. IHP has a strong capacity to support the United Nations, the European
Union and other international organisations. A large variety of IHP standardised modules
- from small Information Communication Technology (ICT) modules and Information
Management (IM) support to large base camps and humanitarian compounds.
Other examples for IHP modules are vehicles support or security equipment, as well
as supporting the establishment of a Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC). IHP is
open for requests for support outside of their modular system. Contributing countries
include, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden and UK.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ihp.nu/about/asia-pacificamerica.html" name="Asia-Pacific Humanitarian Partnership">Asia-Pacific Humanitarian Partnership (APHP)</a> is a regionally based multinational
technical arrangement designed to strengthen the response of humanitarian agencies.
Like the IHP, it is primarily for UN agencies and UNDAC teams, as well as the IFRC
and ASEAN. Basic modules (e.g. laptops, telecommunications equipment, tents and
generators) can be mobilized within six hours for two to four weeks and come with
fully trained support staff. Larger and more complex modules (e.g. light base camps
and environmental support) can be mobilized within one to two days. Countries in Asia
and the Pacific contributing to the APHP with support modules positioned nationally
are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea. Tecoms Sans
Frontieres is an NGO partner.

In addition to the external technical teams that it manages, OCHA has a variety of
internal surge staffing mechanisms by which staff can be deployed to address critical
new or unforeseen humanitarian needs in the field. Deployments typically involve
establishing new OCHA presences or reinforcing existing offices during escalating
crises.
</p>
<p>
In small and medium emergencies, surge support is generally provided by Regional
Office staff, who have local knowledge, a broad range of skills (i.e. information
management, public information, civil-military coordination and reporting) and the
necessary equipment to support them in the field. In larger emergencies Headquartersmanaged
rosters will be used to ensure a transition from initial regional surge to
medium- to longer-term support.

into a rapid response window and an underfunded emergencies window.
Rapid response grants are provided to support critical, life-saving activities in suddenonset
disasters and situations of acute need, as well as other time-critical interventions
not funded by other sources.<sup class="pop" data-toggle="popover" data-content="For the purposes of this Guide, the rapid response facility is of most relevance. Allocations from the underfunded
emergencies window are made twice a year and target activities in countries experiencing ongoing emergencies that have
not been funded by other donors. Approximately one third of the CERF's grant facility is reserved for the underfunded
emergencies window.">22</sup>
<p>
As a guideline, CERF rapid response funding does not exceed US$30 million per
country per emergency, although the ERC can offer funding beyond this amount if s/
he believes it is necessary. In most instances, the CERF rapid response provision aims to
be about 10 per cent of the total funding requested in a Flash Appeal. However, the
CERF does not depend on issuance of any Appeal.

<a name="OCHA Information Management Units and the Humanitarian Information Centre">OCHA Information Management Unit (IMU) and the Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC)</a>. In most countries where there are ongoing emergency responses,
there is also usually an OCHA country office that also has a dedicated information
management capacity, normally in the form of an IMU. This includes technical staff
who serve as an information service for the humanitarian community by developing
and promoting common standards that enable data exchange between organizations.
They consolidate this information to provide an overview of the humanitarian
response. They also provide technical support to initiatives such as needs assessments,
and publish information products such as contacts lists, meeting schedules and maps.
The OCHA-IMU works in close collaboration with information management focal
points in Government and in the Cluster lead agencies to aggregate information and
provide an overall view of the emergency response. To facilitate this exchange of data,
an Information Management Network is often formed which includes IM staff from
OCHA, key Government agencies (NDMO, National Statistics Agency, etc.) and cluster
lead agencies.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a very large and complex emergency response, and when adequate
information management capacity is not available in the clusters, technical capacity
can be increased by deploying a HIC. The HIC would deploy with additional human
resources, hardware such as large format plotters, and set up a physical space where
relief organizations can manage and share information about an emergency.
</p>
</div><!-- /well -->
<div class="well well-primary">
<h4>What does "information management" mean?</h4>
<p>
Humanitarian information management is defined as the collection, processing,
analysis and dissemination of information to support decision-making and
coordination in an emergency.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Collection</strong> : Data collection can take many forms, from needs assessments to
remote sensing to a review of baseline data.</li>
<li><strong>Processing</strong> : Sufficient time and skilled staff must be allocated for data to be
processed. For example, before 200 assessment questionnaires can be analysed
and used for planning, they must be checked and entered into a database.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong> : In an emergency, analysis is usually limited to summarizing
information, prioritizing and learning something new. Decision makers require
analysis that summarizes a large volume of information and points out key aspects
of the emergency situation.</li>
<li><strong>Dissemination</strong> : Information needs to be communicated clearly and
effectively to a wide audience using the appropriate medium, whether in an
e-mail, a report, a map, a briefing or a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Preparedness in information management is critical to its effectiveness in an
emergency. Preparedness measures can include: collecting key baseline data;
establishing an information management network, including NDMOs, national
statistics offices, national mapping agencies, OCHA and cluster lead agencies;
ensuring that information management is addressed in the contingency plan; and
developing a full needs-assessment methodology.

new crisis or following the deterioration of an ongoing emergency). They are not used
to report on chronic emergencies.<sup class="pop" data-toggle="popover" data-content="As the response transitions out of its acute phase, OCHA will transition the Sitrep to a Humanitarian Bulletin, which is the
weekly and/or monthly product normally produced by an in-country OCHA presence (including in chronic emergencies).">27</sup> The OCHA Head of Office, in consultation with
the UN RC and/or HC, decides whether a specific disaster event merits a Sitrep. Other
OCHA reporting products may also be rolled out to support humanitarian decisionmaking.
The Humanitarian Snapshot is an info-graphic (including a full-page map,
graphics and textual summaries) that provides timely, visual insight into the situation.
The Humanitarian Dashboard is an IASC tool designed to help clusters and HCTs
monitor implementation of the response plan over the course of a crisis.
</p>
<p>
Situation reports are also issued by other entities and organizations involved in
humanitarian response, most notably by UN Agencies, international and local NGOs,
as well as Regional Organizations such as ASEAN. In countries where OCHA does not
have a formal presence the situation reports are often issued by the Office of the UN
RC in country. All these sitreps are generally posted and retrievable on the Reliefweb
site.

<a name="Multi-Cluster Initial Rapid Assessment" href="http://assessments.humanitarianresponse.info/">Multi-Cluster Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA)</a> is a multi-sector assessment
methodology carried out by key humanitarian stakeholders during the first two weeks
following a sudden-onset disaster. It aims to provide fundamental information on
the needs of affected people and the priorities for international support. The MIRA
approach produces a preliminary scenario definition within the first 72 hours following
a disaster and a final report within two weeks. MIRA is guided by the IASC Operational
Guidance on Coordinated Assessments in Humanitarian Crises , which was produced
in 2011.
