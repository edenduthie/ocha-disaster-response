							<p>UN RCs and HCs are a Government's first point of contact
								with the international humanitarian system. OCHA typically
								supports UN RCs through its regional offices and HCs through a
								country office or, in some cases, through a HAT. Increasingly,
								OCHA also works directly with relevant Government counterparts,
								particularly NDMOs, to provide support to government-led
								emergency coordination, preparedness activities, and/or capacity
								building. OCHA also provides support to regional organizations
								that have humanitarian mandates.</p>
