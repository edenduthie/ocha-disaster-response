						<h3 class="intro">What is the purpose of this guide?</h3>
						<p>
							<i>Disaster Response in Asia and the Pacific: A Guide to
								International Tools and Services</i> (hereafter referred to as "the
							guide") is designed to help disaster managers in national
							Governments gain basic knowledge of how to use international
							tools and services.
						</p>
						<p>The guide is not prescriptive. It aims to support the
							growing disaster response and disaster response preparedness
							capabilities that exist at national level across Asia and the
							Pacific.</p>
						<h3 class="intro">Who is the guide for?</h3>
						<p>The guide is for national disaster management organizations
							(NDMOs) and line ministries involved in disaster response and
							disaster response preparedness. It is also a reference document
							for representatives of intergovernmental organizations, civil-
							society actors and disaster-affected people.</p>
						<h3 class="intro">What is the scope of the guide?</h3>
						<p>The guide concentrates on key tools and services that can
							be helpful to disaster managers during the response and response
							preparedness phases of the disaster programme cycle. It does not
							include tools and services encompassed by disaster risk reduction
							(DRR) efforts, nor does it cover longer-term disaster recovery
							instruments. The guide includes some entries relevant to conflict
							situations. It does not include tools or services that are being
							developed.</p>
						<h3 class="intro">How can the guide be used?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>To create a common understanding of the tools and
								services available in the region.</li>
							<li>To support emergency decision-making in small, medium
								and large-scale disasters.</li>
							<li>To help locate international technical expertise before
								and at the onset of a disaster.</li>
							<li>To facilitate partnerships between humanitarian actors.</li>
							<li>To inform academic curricula at national and regional
								learning institutions.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="intro">How is the guide organized?</h3>

						<p>The guide has three main sections: [I] International
							Humanitarian Architecture; [II] Tools and Services for Disaster
							Response; and [III] Tools and Services for Disaster Response
							Preparedness. The reverse chronological order of the guide -
							response before response preparedness - is intentional. It
							deliberately profiles tools and services for response before
							those for response preparedness to offer a better understanding
							of the utility of certain response preparedness activities and
							how they support response efforts.</p>
						<h3 class="intro">Why has the guide been produced?</h3>
						<p>It has been produced in response to a call by United
							Nations (UN) Members States and other humanitarian stakeholders
							at the 2011 Regional Humanitarian Partnership Workshop for the
							Asia-Pacific Region held in Shanghai, China for a handbook to
							guide disaster managers in understanding the interaction between
							national, regional and international humanitarian response
							mechanisms.</p>
						<p>This version was developed in consultation with some 75
							Government officials across Asia and the Pacific and more than 50
							representatives of intergovernmental organizations, the Red Cross
							and Red Crescent Movement (RCRC Movement), national and
							international NGOs, donors and other key agencies worldwide.</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Disaster response:</strong> the provision of assistance
									or intervention during or immediately after a disaster to meet
									the life preservation and basic subsistence needs of those
									people affected.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Disaster response preparedness:</strong> pre-disaster
									activities that are undertaken to minimize loss of life, injury
									and property damage in a disaster, and to ensure that rescue,
									relief, rehabilitation and other services can be provided
									following a disaster. Preparedness for the first and immediate
									response is called "emergency preparedness".
