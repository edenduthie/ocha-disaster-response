With a clear understanding of the primary international tools and services available
in disaster response, it is now possible to review the suite of international disaster
response preparedness services available to assist Governments in their planning and
technical capacity building.
</p>
<p>
These tools exist in addition to the growing number of national response preparedness
tools that Governments in the region have developed to support local authorities and
civil society on their sovereign territories. As noted earlier in the guide, the entries
included here are limited to response preparedness tools and services and do not
encompass broader DRR efforts under the Hyogo Framework Agreement or the
general rubric of preparedness.

training course that UNDAC roster participants are required to take every two years to
maintain these skill levels. Once a year, an UNDAC specialty course on environmental
emergencies is also offered.

In addition to engagement with the INSARAG Guidelines, INSARAG member countries
with USAR teams deploying internationally are encouraged to apply for IEC. The IEC
is an independent, peer-review process of international USAR teams endorsed by

The US Forest Service also provides training and technical assistance in other incident
management system components, including Emergency Operation Centre (EOC)
management, Multi-Agency Coordination (MAC) systems and Exercise Design/
