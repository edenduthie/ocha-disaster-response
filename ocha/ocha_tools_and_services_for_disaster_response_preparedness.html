With a clear understanding of the primary international tools and services available
in disaster response, it is now possible to review the suite of international disaster
response preparedness services available to assist Governments in their planning and
technical capacity building.
</p>
<p>
These tools exist in addition to the growing number of national response preparedness
tools that Governments in the region have developed to support local authorities and
civil society on their sovereign territories. As noted earlier in the guide, the entries
included here are limited to response preparedness tools and services and do not
encompass broader DRR efforts under the Hyogo Framework Agreement or the
general rubric of preparedness.

training course that UNDAC roster participants are required to take every two years to
maintain these skill levels. Once a year, an UNDAC specialty course on environmental

In addition to engagement with the INSARAG Guidelines, INSARAG member countries

<a name="Legal preparedness for disasters consistent with IDRL Guidelines" href="http://www.ifrc.org/dl">Legal preparedness for disasters consistent with IDRL Guidelines</a> addresses the
initiation, facilitation, transit and regulation of international disaster relief and initial
recovery assistance. Preparedness planning can include the review and development of
disaster management laws, immigration laws, customs laws, quarantine procedures,
and civil and criminal liability processes. The IFRC facilitated review of national legislation
on disaster management usually takes between six and eight months. However, the
development of new laws is a longer-term process, as these laws are subject to the
review and adoption processes of a particular country's legal system.
</p>
<p>
A model legislation developed by IFRC to support legal preparedness for disasters by
national Governments is called the <a href="http://www.ifrc.org/PageFiles/88609/Pilot%2520Model%2520Act%2520on%2520IDRL%2520%28English%29.pdf">Model Act for the Facilitation and Regulation
of International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance</a>. It is a reference
tool and example for lawmakers on how to develop legislation appropriate to the
national situation, keeping in mind the different legal and disaster response systems
across states.
</p>
<p>
The implementation of the IDRL Guidelines and the Model Act are designed to greatly
enhance the timely response during a sudden onset disaster or emergency.

	<!--<i class="icon-book"></i>--> IDRL in action : the cases of Indonesia , Cambodia and the Cook Islands
</h4>
<p>
Between 2004 and 2006, IFRC and the Indonesia Red Cross conducted a series of
studies in collaboration with the Government of Indonesia to identify the legal
issues that had affected international relief operations in that country. Following
intensive consultations involving a wide range of stakeholders, the Government
adopted a new law on disaster management in 2007. In 2008, the President
promulgated Regulation No.23 on the Participation of International Institutions
and Foreign Non-governmental Institutions in Disaster Management, which draws
strongly from the IDRL Guidelines. In December 2010, more detailed and specific
guidelines were adopted, titled "The Role of International Organisations and
Foreign Nongovernment Organisations during Emergency Response".
</p>
<p>
In 2008, IFRC initiated support to the Government of Cambodia and the
Cambodia Red Cross Society in their undertaking of an IDRL technical assistance
project to analyse the national legal framework for international assistance.
Following this review, Cambodia drafted a new disaster management law. If
passed in its current form by Parliament, it will be one of the most comprehensive
disaster management laws in the Asia-Pacific region, with an entire chapter
dedicated to international assistance.
</p>
<p>
The IDRL Guidelines are also having a significant impact in the Pacific. Following the
completion of an IDRL study in the Cook Islands, the Cook Islands Prime Minister
raised the importance of the IDRL Guidelines with leaders of Pacific Island States
during the 43rd Pacific Island Forum in August 2012. The Forum Communique
encourages the Pacific Island States to use the IDRL Guidelines to strengthen their
national policy and institutional and legal frameworks in collaboration with their
National Red Cross Societies, IFRC, the UN and other relevant partners.
</p>
<p>
Indonesia, New Zealand and the Philippines have adopted new laws, regulations or
procedures at the national level with provisions inspired by or consistent with the
IDRL Guidelines. Legal review processes and/or IDRL studies conducted by IFRC and
National Societies have been completed or are underway in Afghanistan, Cambodia,
the Cook Islands, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vanuatu and Viet Nam. For
detailed information on the progress of IDRL technical assistance projects in Asia and
the Pacific, see here.

dialogue partners. Some examples include the US-Thai Cobra Gold exercises, MPAT
Tempest Express exercises and the US-Philippines Balikatan exercises.

There are a growing number of early warning systems available to disaster managers in
Asia and the Pacific. Early warning systems vary in geographic and thematic coverage,
and offer different levels of situational awareness, alerting and executive decisionmaking
support to national Governments and their partners. The early warning
systems listed here are the regional and international systems that exist in addition to
the mechanisms operated by national meteorological agencies and other Government
entities in the region, including NDMOs.
</p>
<p>
Fourteen early warning systems are described in this section. For ease of reference, this
section consists of a summary table only.
