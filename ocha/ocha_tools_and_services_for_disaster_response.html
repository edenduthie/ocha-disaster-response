A range of international technical teams can be mobilized within hours of a disaster
to support a Government’s relief efforts. Described here are the purpose, composition
and activation modalities of (a) bilateral, (b) intergovernmental and (c) RCRC
Movement. These teams are generally deployed in large- and sometimes mediumscale
disasters. They exist in addition to the many sector-specific technical teams
deployed by Governments, clusters, and other individual agencies and are designed to
complement their work.

Bilateral
Urban Search and Rescue teams are composed of trained experts who provide
rescue and medical assistance in an emergency. USAR teams that deploy internationally
generally comprise expert personnel, specialized equipment and search dogs. They
can be operational within 24 to 48 hours of a disaster. USAR teams are offered and
received bilaterally and/or with the coordination support of the OCHA-managed
International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG). The advantage of working
with INSARAG to receive international USAR teams is that their precise capacities and
capabilities are specified through an INSARAG External Classification (IEC) and the
teams work according to internationally-agreed standards and modalities.
Additionally, there are two complementary coordination mechanisms that support
INSARAG’s USAR deployments:
Virtual On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (Virtual OSOCC) is a global
online network and information portal that facilitates data exchange between disaster
responders and affected counties before, during and after sudden-onset disasters. It is
the first place to look to see if a Government is requesting search-and-rescue support,
and to track the arrival and position of different USAR teams.
On-Site Operations Coordination Center (OSOCC) is a physical facility established
in the USAR-requesting country to receive incoming and support inter-USAR
coordination. At the OSOCC, international relief teams are registered and receive
basic information about the situation, the operations of national and international
responders, and logistical arrangements.
USAR teams support the search-and-rescue efforts of national Governments,
particularly in urban settings where there are collapsed structures.
Who are the y for ?
A Government seeking assistance in activating international USAR teams through
INSARAG can do so through a pre-identified INSARAG National Focal Point or directly
through the INSARAG secretariat at insarag@un.org. Account access to the Virtual
OSOCC can be requested here. Further information about OSOCC is available through
OCHA-ROAP at ocha-roap@un.org

Bilateral technical response teams are emergency teams deployed by assisting
Governments to make an initial assessment of needs for contributions to the affected
Government and/or to UN agencies, the RCRC Movement, and NGOs. Some key
bilateral technical response teams active in Asia and the Pacific include the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Disaster Assistance Response
Team (DART), the United Kingdom Department for International Development
(DFID)’s Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department (CHASE), Japan International

What is the difference between “light ”, “medium ”
and “heav y” USAR teams ?
According to INSARAG’s classification system, USAR teams are classified in three
categories: light, medium and heavy.
1. Light USAR teams have the operational capability to assist with surface
search and rescue in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Light USAR teams
are not normally recommended for international deployment.
2. Medium USAR teams have the operational capability to conduct technical
search-and-rescue operations in structural-collapse incidents. Medium
USAR teams are required to be able to search for trapped people.
International Medium USAR teams travelling to an affected country should
be operational in the affected country within 32 hours of when the disaster
was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A medium team must be adequately
staffed to allow for 24-hour operations at one site for up to seven days.
3. Heav y USAR teams have the operational capability for difficult and
complex technical search-and-rescue operations. Heavy USAR teams are
required to be able to search for trapped people and use canine and technical
systems. They are also required to provide international assistance in disasters
resulting in the collapse of multiple structures, typically in urban settings,
when national response capacity has either been overwhelmed or does not
have the required capability. International heavy USAR teams travelling to an
affected country should be operational in the affected country within 48
hours of when the disaster was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A heavy team
must be adequately resourced to allow for 24-hour operations at two
separate sites for up to 10 days.

Intergovernmental
UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams are standby teams of
specially-trained international disaster management professionals from UN Member
States, UN agencies and other disaster response organizations that can be deployed
within 12 to 48 hours of a disaster. The primary elements of the UNDAC mandate
are assessment, coordination and information management. UNDAC teams are self-
The majority of these bilateral technical response teams are designed to support the
assisting (donor) Government in making a decision on what type of support to provide
during an emergency response. Some, such as the Japan Disaster Response (JDR)
team, also provide search and rescue, medical and other technical support.
Who are the y for ?
More information on these bilateral technical response teams can be attained from
the embassies of the respective countries.

An UNDAC team can be deplo yed even if the
Government does not issue a general request for
international assistance : the case of Japan
Following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the Government of Japan requested
a specialized UNDAC team even though it did not request more general international
assistance.
Deployed within 48 hours, the seven-member UNDAC team provided emergency
support operations based out of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) office in Tokyo over a period of 10 days. The UNDAC team’s terms of reference
requested by the Government of Japan were as follows:
1. To report to the international community on the emergency situation.
2. To advise the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on how to respond to the
numerous offers of assistance.
3. To assist, from Tokyo, in coordinating the international USAR teams
deployed to Japan.
A word on UNDAC technical partnerships
UNDAC teams work with a number of technical NGOs and other partners to ensure
rapid deployment and self-sufficiency. Examples include UNDAC partnerships with
Télécoms Sans Frontières for telecommunications, with MapAction for on-site mapping
services, with DHL for airport logistics and with UNOSAT for satellite imagery.
UNDAC teams are deployed to support Governments and international aid
organizations. An UNDAC team’s deployment is free of charge. Team members
are funded through pre-arranged agreements with UNDAC member agencies and
Governments.
Who are the y for ?
An UNDAC team is deployed at the request of an affected Government, the UN RC
or the HC. An UNDAC team can be requested through OCHA at +41 22 917 1600,

sufficient in telecommunications, office and personal equipment. An UNDAC team
normally stays in the affected area for the initial response phase, which can be up to
three weeks.
36
ASEAN Emergency Rapid Assessment Teams (ERAT) are a pool of trained and
rapidly deployable (within 24 hours) experts on emergency assessment, for disasters
in ASEAN countries. The purpose of the ASEAN ERAT is to assist NDMOs in the
earliest phase of an emergency in a variety of areas including (a) conducting rapid
assessments; (b) estimating the scale, severity and impact of the disaster through a
damage assessment and needs analysis; (c) gathering information and reporting on
the immediate needs of affected people; and (d) coordinating with the AHA Centre for
the mobilization, response and deployment of regional disaster management assets,
capacities and humanitarian goods and assistance to the disaster-affected areas.
ASEAN ERAT members consist of trained NDMOs and related ministries staff from
within the 10 ASEAN Member States enabling stronger collaboration with affected
ASEAN Member States’ government and communities.
ASEAN-ERAT are deployed to support disaster-affected ASEAN Member States.
Who are the y for ?
The ASEAN-ERAT deployment is free of charge. ERATs are deployed through a request
to the ASEAN AHA Centre at info@ahacentre.org, or at +62 21 2305006 or through
the ASEAN National Focal Point.

Joint OCHA/UNEP Environment Unit (JEU) is the UN emergency response
mechanism that provides international assistance to countries facing environmental
emergencies. Environmental emergency specialists, such as chemists, water
management experts, geologists and engineers, can be deployed individually or as
part of a larger UNDAC team. These specialists work with national agencies and often
the military to identify and prioritize environmental risks using the Flash Environmental
Assessment Tool (FEAT). Specialized equipment for detecting hazardous materials and
onsite sampling and analysis can be mobilized through its HazMat Module (Singapore)
and Mobile Laboratory (Netherlands).
Joint OCHA/UNEP Environment Units are deployed to support Governments.
Who are the y for ?
Support for an environmental emergency and/or a natural disaster with secondary
environmental consequences can be requested by a Government through preidentified
JEU National Focal Points, or through the Environmental Emergency
Notification/Request for International Assistance form, which is on the OCHA/UNEP
website.

RCRC Movement
Regional Disaster Response Teams (RDRTs) are trained regional response teams
composed of National Society staff and volunteers who can be deployed within 24 to 48
hours of a disaster to bring assistance to National Societies in neighbouring countries.
RDRTs aim to promote the building of regional capacities in disaster management. The

primary functions of RDRT members are as follows:
1. To undertake primary assessments
2. To develop operational planning
3. To conduct relief management
Field Assessment Coordination Teams (FACT) are rapidly deployable teams
comprising RCRC Movement disaster assessment managers who support National
Societies and IFRC field offices. FACT members have technical expertise in relief,
logistics, health, nutrition, public health and epidemiology, psychological support,
water and sanitation, and finance and administration. FACTs are on standby and can
be deployed anywhere in the world within 12 to 24 hours for two to four weeks.
Emergency Response Units (ERUs) are teams of trained technical specialists
mandated to give immediate support to National Societies in disaster-affected
countries. They provide specific support or direct services when local facilities are
destroyed, overwhelmed by need or do not exist. ERUs work closely with FACT. The
teams use pre-packed sets of standardized equipment and are designed to be selfsufficient
for one month. ERUs can be deployed within 24 to 72 hours and can operate
for up to four months.
TOOLS AND SERVICES FOR DISASTER RESPONSE
How can Governments manage international
technical team deplo yment ?
One of the main challenges for disaster-affected Governments in the
initial hours and days of an emergency is managing numerous offers of
assistance, including offers to deploy USAR and other technical response
teams. In the midst of a crisis, it can be difficult for Governments to
evaluate what is and is not required. It can also be difficult to say turn
down offers of assistance.
It is important for states to remember that while “medium” and “heavy”
USAR teams can be critical to search and rescue in larger-scale disasters,
“light” teams are generally responsible for the highest percentage of livesaving
activities in an emergency. This is because, light teams are locally
based and they can immediately start operating when the disaster strikes.
Generally speaking, international USAR teams (“medium” and “heavy”
teams) should only be accepted if they can be operational within 36 hours
of a disaster, which is the critical window within which most lives can
actually be saved.
38
RE MEMBER
• Disaster-affected States should develop detailed preparedness plans
so that they know the number and types of USAR and other technical
response teams that they are likely to accept in a disaster situation.
• Disaster-affected States are encouraged to work with international
technical entities to agree on the composition, terms of reference and
period of activation of technical teams.
• In addition to the teams described here, some global clusters have
rapid response teams composed of regionally based experts such as
child protection and GBV advisors that can be deployed rapidly.
TOOLS AND SERVICES FOR DISASTER RESPONSE
For this reason, it is important for national Governments to think ahead
about the types of disaster risk they face and evaluate the types of technical
assistance they might wish to accept as a result, from whom and in what
order of priority. Some teams can be requested to arrive in anticipation of
an expected need, for example if it is known that there will be a typhoon
affecting a certain area or population.
It can also be useful for Governments to request UNDAC (or ASEAN ERAT)
teams to manage the process of accepting or declining international offers
of assistance on their behalf. In that way, Government officials can focus
on delivering assistance to affected people through the national response
resources.
Technical services mobilization
In addition to technical teams deployable in an emergency, there are technical services
that can be triggered to support national Governments and international organizations
in their response. For the purposes of the guide, technical services include everything
from pre-positioned supplies to communications technology packages to emergency
surge rosters. The technical services described in this section are organized according
to three areas: (a) relief assets and stockpiles; (b) technical networks; and (c) standby
and surge rosters.

3. NORCAP, ProCap, GenCAP and ACAPS
Relief assets and stockpiles
Military and Civil-Defence Assets (MCDA) are uniformed assets and services
contributed by foreign military and civil-defence organizations for humanitarian
assistance. They include relief personnel, equipment (e.g. air, ground and sea transport,
communication equipment), and supplies and services (e.g. medical support, security
services). MCDA are provided at no cost to the affected State and/or to the United
Nations, unless otherwise regulated by international agreement.
MCDA that are deployed through a central request to support UN agencies are called UN
MCDA. MCDA and UN MCDA are governed by individual Status of Forces Agreements
between two countries and/or by the Oslo Guidelines on the Use of Foreign Military
and Civil Defence Assets in Disaster Relief.
The Use of Militar y Assets in Disasters in Asia and the
Pacific : some ke y principles
MCDA should be seen as tools that complement existing relief mechanisms in
response to the humanitarian gap between the needs that the relief community is
being asked to satisfy and the resources available to meet them.
MCDA can be mobilized and deployed bilaterally or under regional or international
alliance agreements as “other deployed forces” or as part of a United Nations
operation as “UN MCDA”. All disaster relief, including MCDA, should be provided at
the request or with the consent of the affected State and, in principle, on the basis of
an appeal for international assistance.
An assisting State deciding to employ its MCDA should bear in mind the cost/benefit
ratio of such operations as compared with other alternatives, if available. In principle,
MCDA should be requested only as a last resort, and the costs involved in using
MCDA on disaster relief missions abroad should not be diverted from those available
for international relief and development activities.20

International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP) is an informal network of seven
governmental organisations in Europe working in support of emergency operations
on a daily basis. IHP has a strong capacity to support the United Nations, the European
Union and other international organisations. A large variety of IHP standardised modules
- from small Information Communication Technology (ICT) modules and Information
Management (IM) support to large base camps and humanitarian compounds.
Other examples for IHP modules are vehicles support or security equipment, as well
as supporting the establishment of a Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC). IHP is
open for requests for support outside of their modular system. Contributing countries
include, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden and UK.
Asia-Pacific Humanitarian Partnership (APHP) is a regionally based multinational
technical arrangement designed to strengthen the response of humanitarian agencies.
Like the IHP, it is primarily for UN agencies and UNDAC teams, as well as the IFRC
and ASEAN. Basic modules (e.g. laptops, telecommunications equipment, tents and
generators) can be mobilized within six hours for two to four weeks and come with
fully trained support staff. Larger and more complex modules (e.g. light base camps
and environmental support) can be mobilized within one to two days. Countries in Asia
and the Pacific contributing to the APHP with support modules positioned nationally
are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea. Télécoms Sans
Frontières is an NGO partner.
IHP and APHP are primarily for UN agencies and UNDAC teams but can also be used by
the RCRC Movement, Regional organizations and Governments, as requested.

UN Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) Network supports the strategic
stockpiling efforts of UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations to respond to
emergencies. The UNHRD in Asia and the Pacific is located in Subang, Malaysia, and is
managed by WFP. It forms part of a global network of UNHRD hubs.
41
There are currently 11 users of the Subang UNHRD facility: ASEAN, AusAID, CARE,
Irish Aid, JICA, Mercy Corps, MERCY Malaysia, Norwegian Church Aid, Swiss Red
Cross and Shelterbox. WFP, WHO and World Vision International are expected to
stockpile goods at the facility in 2013.

Technical networks
ICRC Family Links Network is the primary global framework for restoring family links
in the aftermath of a disaster. Restoring Family Links (RFL) is the general term given to a
range of activities that aim to prevent the separation of families and the disappearance
of family members, to restore and maintain contact among families and to clarify the
fate of persons who have been reported missing. The Family Links Network consists of
the ICRC’s Central Tracing Agency (CTA), tracing services of National Societies, and the
tracing agencies of governments.
The ICRC Family Links Network is for disaster-affected families with a missing relative.

Standby and surge rosters
In addition to the external technical teams that it manages, OCHA has a variety of
internal surge staffing mechanisms by which staff can be deployed to address critical
new or unforeseen humanitarian needs in the field. Deployments typically involve
establishing new OCHA presences or reinforcing existing offices during escalating
crises.
In small and medium emergencies, surge support is generally provided by Regional
Office staff, who have local knowledge, a broad range of skills (i.e. information
management, public information, civil-military coordination and reporting) and the
necessary equipment to support them in the field. In larger emergencies Headquartersmanaged
rosters will be used to ensure a transition from initial regional surge to
medium- to longer-term support.
1. Emergency Response Roster (ERR): The ERR is OCHA’s main internal
mechanism for short-term deployment of staff to larger emergencies. Some 35
OCHA staff are on the roster at any one time, and can be deployed within days
for up to six weeks21. All of the regular profiles found in OCHA field offices can be
sourced through the ERR.
2. Associates Surge Pool (ASP): The ASP was developed to bridge the gap
between immediate surge and the arrival of regular staffing. The ASP is composed
of pre-cleared ‘externals’ who can be quickly recruited and deployed. The average
ASP deployment is three to six months.
WFP manages two common service clusters that provide important technical standby
and surge capacities to humanitarian organizations from the onset of an emergency.
These are the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster and the Logistics Cluster.
1. Emergency Telecommunications Cluster provides in-country inter-agency
telecommunications infrastructure, services and expertise for humanitarian
organizations in an emergency.
2. Logistics Cluster deploys logistics response teams to emergencies to assume an
initial logistics coordination role for humanitarian organizations.
21
Exceptionally, deployment can be extended to a maximum three months.
43
In-country telecommunications and logistics support through the WFP-led global
clusters are for humanitarian organizations. Representatives from aid organizations
interested in participating in ICT or logistics coordination and information sharing can
attend local working group meetings.

TOOLS AND SERVICES FOR DISASTER RESPONSE
The UN and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have established a number
of standby and surge capacities to reinforce technical expertise in emergencies. The
largest general surge roster is called the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Standby
Roster (NORCAP). It provides expertise in everything from protection and emergency
education, to logistics and engineering through rapid deployment of professional and
experienced personnel. In addition to NORCAP, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC)
also manages the following thematic standby and surge rosters:
1. The Protection Standby Capacity Roster (ProCap) responds to priority gaps
and needs in emergency protection response at the country level.
2. The Gender Standby Capacity Roster (GenCap) builds the capacity of
humanitarian actors at country level to mainstream gender equality
programming, including prevention and response to gender-based violence, in all
sectors of humanitarian response.
3. The Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) is an assessment standby capacity
that provides accessible expertise, timely data and analysis to inform decisionmaking

Many technical services are designed to reinforce the emergency response
capacities of UN and other international agencies. However, these
packages are flexible, and national Governments are encouraged to reach
out to technical entities to explore preparedness arrangements for direct

Financial resourceS mobilization
“Fast money” is a critical tool in kick-starting response at the onset of a disaster.
This section describes international financial resource tools that can be mobilized to
support immediate life-saving and relief efforts. The purpose of these mechanisms is to
disperse funds quickly based on initial assessments and response plans, while in-depth
assessments and strategic planning are organized to mobilize larger sums of money
for longer-term recovery.
This section also describes the international strategic planning and resource mobilization
tools used in sudden-onset and protracted crises, namely the Flash Appeal and the
Consolidated Appeal Process.
The mechanisms described herein are multilateral mechanisms. National disaster
funding, bilateral contributions and private donations are also central to rapid disaster
response.

“Fast money” mechanisms
Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is an OCHA-managed UN fund intended
to kick start emergency humanitarian assistance. The CERF comprises both a US$ 450
million grant element and a US$30 million loan facility. The grant element is subdivided
into a rapid response window and an underfunded emergencies window.
Rapid response grants are provided to support critical, life-saving activities in suddenonset
disasters and situations of acute need, as well as other time-critical interventions
not funded by other sources.22
As a guideline, CERF rapid response funding does not exceed US$30 million per
country per emergency, although the ERC can offer funding beyond this amount if s/
he believes it is necessary. In most instances, the CERF rapid response provision aims to
be about 10 per cent of the total funding requested in a Flash Appeal. However, the
CERF does not depend on issuance of any Appeal.
22 For the purposes of this Guide, the rapid response facility is of most relevance. Allocations from the underfunded
emergencies window are made twice a year and target activities in countries experiencing ongoing emergencies that have
not been funded by other donors. Approximately one third of the CERF’s grant facility is reserved for the underfunded
emergencies window. The loan facility is used by UN agencies to borrow against forthcoming donor commitments.
45
TOOLS AND SERVICES FOR DISASTER RESPONSE
CERF rapid response grants are requested by the UN RC or HC on behalf of the
Humanitarian Country Team. However, once allocated, contractual arrangements are
made between CERF and the recipient agency directly. CERF rapid response grants are
generally dispersed within two weeks of a request.

IFRC Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) is an emergency response fund
that provides immediate financial support to Red Cross and Red Crescent National
Societies, enabling them to carry out their unique role as first responders after a
disaster. Allocations may be made as start-up loans in the case of large-scale disasters,
as grants to meet the costs of responding to small-scale emergency relief operations,
or for making preparations in the case of imminent disaster.
DREF is available to all 187 Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies.
Who is it for ?
The UN General Assembly allows CERF funding to be granted to UN agencies and
IOM only. Non-UN humanitarian partners, including NGOs and technical Government

OCHA Emergency Cash Grant is an emergency relief grant that can be quickly
dispersed in a sudden-onset disaster. The grant represents a relatively small amount
of resources sourced from the UN regular budget and disbursed for pressing relief
activities in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The amount per allocation cannot
exceed US$100,000, although more than one allocation can be made per emergency.
Funds are disbursed within 10 days and can be useful in funding specific, immediate,
life-saving activities such as local procurement, logistics support and/or transporting
relief items.
Emergency cash grants are usually received by the UN RC or HC. The UN RC or HC
may spend the funds directly or seek OCHA's concurrence for their transfer to national
authorities or local NGOs.
Who is it for ?
Funds are requested by the UN RC or HC, or by the OCHA field office or regional
office. A Government can also request an OCHA Emergency Cash Grant through its
Permanent Mission to the UN in Geneva or New York.

early recovery frameworks and establish solid foundations for sustainable recovery.
Funds usually do not exceed US$100,000 and need to be spent within 12 months.
Emergency Response Fund (ERF)23 is a country-based pooled fund managed by the
HC with OCHA support. Typical grant sizes are between US$100,000 and US$250,000.
There are currently 12 ERFs operating worldwide, two of which are in the Asia–Pacific
region: Indonesia and Myanmar. The criteria for establishing an ERF are quite stringent

Development Bank (ADB) designed to provide incremental grant resources to ADB
developing member countries affected by a major natural disaster. The APDRF provides
quick-disbursing grants to help countries meet immediate expenses to restore lifesaving
services to affected people following a declared disaster. Grants are provided
in amounts of up to US$3 million to national Governments. They may in turn allocate
the funds to local government, government agencies, and other suitable national or
international entities, including NGOs.
It is for ADB developing member countries.
Who is it for ?
Assistance is granted directly by ADB to national Governments and based on the
following criteria:
1. A natural disaster has occurred in a developing member country.
2. An emergency has been officially declared and is of a scale beyond the capacity
of the country and its own agencies to meet the immediate expenses necessary to

UN Flash Appeal is an initial inter-agency humanitarian response strategy and
resource mobilization tool based on a rapid appraisal of the disaster situation. The
Flash Appeal identifies the common funding requirements of humanitarian actors for
the earliest phase of the response, generally for the first three to six months. In cases
where emergency response is required for more than six months or in a protracted
emergency, the Flash Appeal is extended and transformed into a CAP.
The Flash Appeal can include projects from UN agencies, other international
organizations, and NGOs. It may also include project partnerships with the RCRC
Movement and/or National Society of the affected country. Government ministries
cannot appeal for funds directly through a Flash Appeal, but may be partners identified
in UN or NGO projects.

The Flash Appeal in action : the case of the Philippines
Following Tropical Storm Washi in the Philippines in 2011, the UN and humanitarian
partners issued a Flash Appeal25 calling for US$ 28.6 million to support the
Government of the Philippines to respond to the serious humanitarian needs caused
by the storm. The Flash Appeal aimed to provide clean water for drinking and
bathing, food, emergency, shelter, and essential household items to 471,000 of the
worst affected people in Cagayan de Oro and Iligan cities for three months.26

Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) is an advocacy and financing tool that brings
aid organizations together jointly to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor disaster
response. It comprises a common humanitarian action plan and a portfolio of concrete
projects necessary to implement that plan. It serves as an ongoing frame of reference
and detailed work plan for large-scale, sustained humanitarian action. A Consolidated
Appeal is generally launched when humanitarian needs extend beyond the period of a
Flash Appeal (usually six months).
The CAP includes projects implemented by UN agencies, the RCRC Movement, IOM,
and NGOs. Governments cannot seek money through the CAP, although it does
encourage close cooperation between donors, humanitarian organizations, and host
Governments. As with the Flash Appeal, Governments may be identified as partners
in implementing specific projects.

RE MEMBER
• While many “fast money” mechanisms are not directly available to
affected States, Governments should work closely with the UN, the
RCRC Movement and NGOs to ensure the appropriate use of these relief
funds.
• Bilateral fast track monies are also a very important source of funding
available to affected Governments for initial life-saving activities. The
amount and details of the funding vary and are generally negotiated on
a case-by-case basis between assisting and affected Governments.

Information management and assessments
Managing information following a disaster is a crucial part of any humanitarian
response. Strong information management requires agreed processes and trained
personnel to collect, analyze and share information about a disaster situation. Affected
people, affected Governments, humanitarian organizations and the media are all
sources and users of information in an emergency.
Governments have their own mechanisms for sharing and managing information
between emergency response-related agencies and ministries. This section explains
how the international humanitarian community manages information in an emergency
with a view to helping Governments better understand how the international
community functions, and to identify key areas where Governments and international
organizations can work together and share information.

What does “information management ” mean ?
Humanitarian information management is defined as the collection, processing,
analysis and dissemination of information to support decision-making and
coordination in an emergency.
1. Collection : Data collection can take many forms, from needs assessments to
remote sensing to a review of baseline data.
2. Processing : Sufficient time and skilled staff must be allocated for data to be
processed. For example, before 200 assessment questionnaires can be analysed
and used for planning, they must be checked and entered into a database.
3. Analysis : In an emergency, analysis is usually limited to summarizing
information, prioritizing and learning something new. Decision makers require
analysis that summarizes a large volume of information and points out key aspects
of the emergency situation.
4. Dissemination : Information needs to be communicated clearly and
effectively to a wide audience using the appropriate medium, whether in an
e-mail, a report, a map, a briefing or a website.
Preparedness in information management is critical to its effectiveness in an
emergency. Preparedness measures can include: collecting key baseline data;
establishing an information management network, including NDMOs, national
statistics offices, national mapping agencies, OCHA and cluster lead agencies;
ensuring that information management is addressed in the contingency plan; and
developing a full needs-assessment methodology.
there is also usually an OCHA country office that also has a dedicated information
management capacity, normally in the form of an IMU. This includes technical staff
who serve as an information service for the humanitarian community by developing
and promoting common standards that enable data exchange between organizations.
They consolidate this information to provide an overview of the humanitarian
response. They also provide technical support to initiatives such as needs assessments,
and publish information products such as contacts lists, meeting schedules and maps.
The OCHA-IMU works in close collaboration with information management focal
points in Government and in the Cluster lead agencies to aggregate information and
provide an overall view of the emergency response. To facilitate this exchange of data,
an Information Management Network is often formed which includes IM staff from
OCHA, key Government agencies (NDMO, National Statistics Agency, etc.) and cluster
lead agencies.
In the case of a very large and complex emergency response, and when adequate
information management capacity is not available in the clusters, technical capacity
can be increased by deploying a HIC. The HIC would deploy with additional human
resources, hardware such as large format plotters, and set up a physical space where
relief organizations can manage and share information about an emergency.
The OCHA-IMU, as well as the HIC, is for Governments and humanitarian organizations.
Information Management capacity in the cluster lead agencies supports cluster
members and line ministries.

Reporting tools
OCHA Situation Report (Sitrep) is an operational document issued by OCHA that
provides a snapshot of current needs, response efforts and gaps in an emergency.
Sitreps are only issued during the acute phase of an emergency (i.e. at the onset of a
new crisis or following the deterioration of an ongoing emergency). They are not used
to report on chronic emergencies.27 The OCHA Head of Office, in consultation with
the UN RC and/or HC, decides whether a specific disaster event merits a Sitrep. Other
OCHA reporting products may also be rolled out to support humanitarian decisionmaking.
The Humanitarian Snapshot is an info-graphic (including a full-page map,
graphics and textual summaries) that provides timely, visual insight into the situation.
The Humanitarian Dashboard is an IASC tool designed to help clusters and HCTs
monitor implementation of the response plan over the course of a crisis.
Situation reports are also issued by other entities and organizations involved in
humanitarian response, most notably by UN Agencies, international and local NGOs,
as well as Regional Organizations such as ASEAN. In countries where OCHA does not
have a formal presence the situation reports are often issued by the Office of the UN
RC in country. All these sitreps are generally posted and retrievable on the Reliefweb
site.
It is accessed in-country through OCHA.
How is it accessed ?
The Sitrep audience is operational humanitarian actors working inside and outside
the affected country, as well as donors, Governments, civil-society organizations, the
media and the public.
Who is it for ?
Sitreps are publicly accessible on ReliefWeb and www.unocha.org/roap for public
access. Interested actors may also subscribe to receive Sitreps issued by OCHA globally
(email ochareporting@un.org to request inclusion) and/or in the Asia-Pacific Region
(email ocha-roap@un.org to request inclusion).

as news articles, public reports, press releases, appeals, policy documents, analysis
and maps related to humanitarian emergencies worldwide. To ensure ReliefWeb is
updated around the clock, it maintains offices in three time zones: New York, Bangkok
and Nairobi.

methodology carried out by key humanitarian stakeholders during the first two weeks
following a sudden-onset disaster. It aims to provide fundamental information on
the needs of affected people and the priorities for international support. The MIRA
approach produces a preliminary scenario definition within the first 72 hours following
a disaster and a final report within two weeks. MIRA is guided by the IASC Operational
Guidance on Coordinated Assessments in Humanitarian Crises , which was produced
in 2011.
