<span class="org">Urban Search and Rescue teams</span> are composed of trained experts who provide
rescue and medical assistance in an emergency. USAR teams that deploy internationally
generally comprise expert personnel, specialized equipment and search dogs. They
can be operational within 24 to 48 hours of a disaster. USAR teams are offered and
received bilaterally and/or with the coordination support of the OCHA-managed
International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG). The advantage of working
with INSARAG to receive international USAR teams is that their precise capacities and
capabilities are specified through an INSARAG External Classification (IEC) and the
teams work according to internationally-agreed standards and modalities.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there are two complementary coordination mechanisms that support
INSARAG's USAR deployments:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vosocc.unocha.org/">Virtual On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (Virtual OSOCC)</a> is a global
online network and information portal that facilitates data exchange between disaster
responders and affected counties before, during and after sudden-onset disasters. It is
the first place to look to see if a Government is requesting search-and-rescue support,
and to track the arrival and position of different USAR teams.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.unocha.org/what-we-do/coordination-tools/osocc-rdc/overview">On-Site Operations Coordination Center (OSOCC)</a> is a physical facility established
in the USAR-requesting country to receive incoming and support inter-USAR
coordination. At the OSOCC, international relief teams are registered and receive
basic information about the situation, the operations of national and international
responders, and logistical arrangements.

Governments to make an initial assessment of needs for contributions to the affected
Government and/or to UN agencies, the RCRC Movement, and NGOs. Some key
bilateral technical response teams active in Asia and the Pacific include the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID)'s Disaster Assistance Response

<h4>
	<i class="icon-book"></i> What is the difference between "light", "medium" and "heavy" USAR teams?
</h4>
<p>
According to INSARAG's classification system, USAR teams are classified in three
categories: light, medium and heavy.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Light USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to assist with surface
search and rescue in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Light USAR teams
are not normally recommended for international deployment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medium USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to conduct technical
search-and-rescue operations in structural-collapse incidents. Medium
USAR teams are required to be able to search for trapped people.
International Medium USAR teams travelling to an affected country should
be operational in the affected country within 32 hours of when the disaster
was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A medium team must be adequately
staffed to allow for 24-hour operations at one site for up to seven days.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Heavy USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability for difficult and
complex technical search-and-rescue operations. Heavy USAR teams are
required to be able to search for trapped people and use canine and technical
systems. They are also required to provide international assistance in disasters
resulting in the collapse of multiple structures, typically in urban settings,
when national response capacity has either been overwhelmed or does not
have the required capability. International heavy USAR teams travelling to an
affected country should be operational in the affected country within 48
hours of when the disaster was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A heavy team
must be adequately resourced to allow for 24-hour operations at two
separate sites for up to 10 days.

<h4>
	<i class="icon-book"></i> How can Governments manage international technical team deployment?
</h4>
<p>
One of the main challenges for disaster-affected Governments in the
initial hours and days of an emergency is managing numerous offers of
assistance, including offers to deploy USAR and other technical response
teams. In the midst of a crisis, it can be difficult for Governments to
evaluate what is and is not required. It can also be difficult to say turn
down offers of assistance.
</p>
<p>
It is important for states to remember that while "medium" and "heavy"
USAR teams can be critical to search and rescue in larger-scale disasters,
"light" teams are generally responsible for the highest percentage of livesaving
activities in an emergency. This is because, light teams are locally
based and they can immediately start operating when the disaster strikes.
Generally speaking, international USAR teams ("medium" and "heavy"
teams) should only be accepted if they can be operational within 36 hours
of a disaster, which is the critical window within which most lives can
actually be saved.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, it is important for national Governments to think ahead
about the types of disaster risk they face and evaluate the types of technical
assistance they might wish to accept as a result, from whom and in what
order of priority. Some teams can be requested to arrive in anticipation of
an expected need, for example if it is known that there will be a typhoon
affecting a certain area or population.
</p>
<p>
It can also be useful for Governments to request UNDAC (or ASEAN ERAT)
teams to manage the process of accepting or declining international offers
of assistance on their behalf. In that way, Government officials can focus
on delivering assistance to affected people through the national response
resources.

In addition to technical teams deployable in an emergency, there are technical services
that can be triggered to support national Governments and international organizations
in their response. For the purposes of the guide, technical services include everything
from pre-positioned supplies to communications technology packages to emergency
surge rosters. The technical services described in this section are organized according
to three areas: (a) relief assets and stockpiles; (b) technical networks; and (c) standby
and surge rosters.

<span class="org">Military and Civil-Defence Assets (MCDA)</span> are uniformed assets and services
contributed by foreign military and civil-defence organizations for humanitarian
assistance. They include relief personnel, equipment (e.g. air, ground and sea transport,
communication equipment), and supplies and services (e.g. medical support, security
services). MCDA are provided at no cost to the affected State and/or to the United
Nations, unless otherwise regulated by international agreement.
</p>
<p>
MCDA that are deployed through a central request to support UN agencies are called UN
MCDA. MCDA and UN MCDA are governed by individual Status of Forces Agreements
between two countries and/or by the <i>Oslo Guidelines on the Use of Foreign Military
and Civil Defence Assets in Disaster Relief</i>.

<h4>
	<i class="icon-book"></i> The Use of Military Assets in Disasters in Asia and the Pacific : some key principles

<p>
MCDA should be seen as tools that complement existing relief mechanisms in
response to the humanitarian gap between the needs that the relief community is
being asked to satisfy and the resources available to meet them.
</p>
<p>
MCDA can be mobilized and deployed bilaterally or under regional or international
alliance agreements as ï¿½other deployed forcesï¿½ or as part of a United Nations
operation as ï¿½UN MCDAï¿½. All disaster relief, including MCDA, should be provided at
the request or with the consent of the affected State and, in principle, on the basis of
an appeal for international assistance.
</p>
<p>
An assisting State deciding to employ its MCDA should bear in mind the cost/benefit
ratio of such operations as compared with other alternatives, if available. In principle,
MCDA should be requested only as a last resort, and the costs involved in using
MCDA on disaster relief missions abroad should not be diverted from those available
for international relief and development activities.<sup class="pop" data-toggle="popover" data-content="As noted in the Oslo Guidelines and APC-MADRO.">20</sup>

<a href="http://www.ihp.nu/">International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP)</a> is an informal network of seven
governmental organisations in Europe working in support of emergency operations
on a daily basis. IHP has a strong capacity to support the United Nations, the European
Union and other international organisations. A large variety of IHP standardised modules
- from small Information Communication Technology (ICT) modules and Information
Management (IM) support to large base camps and humanitarian compounds.
Other examples for IHP modules are vehicles support or security equipment, as well
as supporting the establishment of a Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC). IHP is
open for requests for support outside of their modular system. Contributing countries
include, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden and UK.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ihp.nu/about/asia-pacificamerica.html">Asia-Pacific Humanitarian Partnership (APHP)</a> is a regionally based multinational
technical arrangement designed to strengthen the response of humanitarian agencies.
Like the IHP, it is primarily for UN agencies and UNDAC teams, as well as the IFRC
and ASEAN. Basic modules (e.g. laptops, telecommunications equipment, tents and
generators) can be mobilized within six hours for two to four weeks and come with
fully trained support staff. Larger and more complex modules (e.g. light base camps
and environmental support) can be mobilized within one to two days. Countries in Asia
and the Pacific contributing to the APHP with support modules positioned nationally
are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea. Télécoms Sans
Frontiéres is an NGO partner.

In addition to the external technical teams that it manages, OCHA has a variety of
internal surge staffing mechanisms by which staff can be deployed to address critical
new or unforeseen humanitarian needs in the field. Deployments typically involve
establishing new OCHA presences or reinforcing existing offices during escalating
crises.
</p>
<p>
In small and medium emergencies, surge support is generally provided by Regional
Office staff, who have local knowledge, a broad range of skills (i.e. information
management, public information, civil-military coordination and reporting) and the
necessary equipment to support them in the field. In larger emergencies Headquartersmanaged
rosters will be used to ensure a transition from initial regional surge to
medium- to longer-term support.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="org">Emergency Response Roster (ERR)</span>: The ERR is OCHA’s main internal
mechanism for short-term deployment of staff to larger emergencies. Some 35
OCHA staff are on the roster at any one time, and can be deployed within days
for up to six weeks<sup class="pop" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Exceptionally, deployment can be extended to a maximum three months.">21</sup>. All of the regular profiles found in OCHA field offices can be
sourced through the ERR.
</li>
<li>
<span class="org">Associates Surge Pool (ASP)</span>: The ASP was developed to bridge the gap
between immediate surge and the arrival of regular staffing. The ASP is composed
of pre-cleared ‘externals’ who can be quickly recruited and deployed. The average
ASP deployment is three to six months.

The UN and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have established a number
of standby and surge capacities to reinforce technical expertise in emergencies. The
largest general surge roster is called the <a href="http://norcapweb.no/">Norwegian Refugee Council’s Standby
Roster (NORCAP)</a>. It provides expertise in everything from protection and emergency
education, to logistics and engineering through rapid deployment of professional and
experienced personnel. In addition to NORCAP, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC)
also manages the following thematic standby and surge rosters:
</p>
<ol>

“Fast money” is a critical tool in kick-starting response at the onset of a disaster.
This section describes international financial resource tools that can be mobilized to
support immediate life-saving and relief efforts. The purpose of these mechanisms is to
disperse funds quickly based on initial assessments and response plans, while in-depth
assessments and strategic planning are organized to mobilize larger sums of money
for longer-term recovery.
<p>
</p>
This section also describes the international strategic planning and resource mobilization
tools used in sudden-onset and protracted crises, namely the Flash Appeal and the
Consolidated Appeal Process.
