<span class="org">Urban Search and Rescue teams</span> are composed of trained experts who provide
rescue and medical assistance in an emergency. USAR teams that deploy internationally
generally comprise expert personnel, specialized equipment and search dogs. They
can be operational within 24 to 48 hours of a disaster. USAR teams are offered and
received bilaterally and/or with the coordination support of the OCHA-managed
International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG). The advantage of working
with INSARAG to receive international USAR teams is that their precise capacities and
capabilities are specified through an INSARAG External Classification (IEC) and the
teams work according to internationally-agreed standards and modalities.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there are two complementary coordination mechanisms that support
INSARAG's USAR deployments:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vosocc.unocha.org/">Virtual On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (Virtual OSOCC)</a> is a global
online network and information portal that facilitates data exchange between disaster
responders and affected counties before, during and after sudden-onset disasters. It is
the first place to look to see if a Government is requesting search-and-rescue support,
and to track the arrival and position of different USAR teams.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.unocha.org/what-we-do/coordination-tools/osocc-rdc/overview">On-Site Operations Coordination Center (OSOCC)</a> is a physical facility established
in the USAR-requesting country to receive incoming and support inter-USAR
coordination. At the OSOCC, international relief teams are registered and receive
basic information about the situation, the operations of national and international
responders, and logistical arrangements.

<span class="org">Bilateral technical response teams</span> are emergency teams deployed by assisting
Governments to make an initial assessment of needs for contributions to the affected
Government and/or to UN agencies, the RCRC Movement, and NGOs. Some key
bilateral technical response teams active in Asia and the Pacific include the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID)'s Disaster Assistance Response

<h4>
	<i class="icon-book"></i> What is the difference between "light", "medium" and "heavy" USAR teams?
</h4>
<p>
According to INSARAG's classification system, USAR teams are classified in three
categories: light, medium and heavy.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Light USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to assist with surface
search and rescue in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Light USAR teams
are not normally recommended for international deployment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medium USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability to conduct technical
search-and-rescue operations in structural-collapse incidents. Medium
USAR teams are required to be able to search for trapped people.
International Medium USAR teams travelling to an affected country should
be operational in the affected country within 32 hours of when the disaster
was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A medium team must be adequately
staffed to allow for 24-hour operations at one site for up to seven days.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Heavy USAR teams</strong> have the operational capability for difficult and
complex technical search-and-rescue operations. Heavy USAR teams are
required to be able to search for trapped people and use canine and technical
systems. They are also required to provide international assistance in disasters
resulting in the collapse of multiple structures, typically in urban settings,
when national response capacity has either been overwhelmed or does not
have the required capability. International heavy USAR teams travelling to an
affected country should be operational in the affected country within 48
hours of when the disaster was posted on the Virtual OSOCC. A heavy team
must be adequately resourced to allow for 24-hour operations at two
separate sites for up to 10 days.

specially-trained international disaster management professionals from UN Member
States, UN agencies and other disaster response organizations that can be deployed

<h4>
	<i class="icon-book"></i> How can Governments manage international technical team deployment?
</h4>
<p>
One of the main challenges for disaster-affected Governments in the
initial hours and days of an emergency is managing numerous offers of
assistance, including offers to deploy USAR and other technical response
teams. In the midst of a crisis, it can be difficult for Governments to
evaluate what is and is not required. It can also be difficult to say turn
down offers of assistance.
</p>
<p>
It is important for states to remember that while "medium" and "heavy"
USAR teams can be critical to search and rescue in larger-scale disasters,
"light" teams are generally responsible for the highest percentage of livesaving
activities in an emergency. This is because, light teams are locally
based and they can immediately start operating when the disaster strikes.
Generally speaking, international USAR teams ("medium" and "heavy"
teams) should only be accepted if they can be operational within 36 hours
of a disaster, which is the critical window within which most lives can
actually be saved.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, it is important for national Governments to think ahead
about the types of disaster risk they face and evaluate the types of technical
assistance they might wish to accept as a result, from whom and in what
order of priority. Some teams can be requested to arrive in anticipation of
an expected need, for example if it is known that there will be a typhoon
affecting a certain area or population.
</p>
<p>
It can also be useful for Governments to request UNDAC (or ASEAN ERAT)
teams to manage the process of accepting or declining international offers
of assistance on their behalf. In that way, Government officials can focus
on delivering assistance to affected people through the national response
resources.
