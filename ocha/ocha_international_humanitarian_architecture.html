<p>
The first responders in any emergency are disaster-affected people and their
Governments. When Governments request international humanitarian support to
respond to disasters, national legal systems are the main regulatory frameworks to
ensure the protection of disaster-affected people.
</p>
<p>
Humanitarian action is also regulated by binding and non-binding international
humanitarian and human rights law, as well as the humanitarian principles of humanity,
neutrality, impartiality and independence.

[1] water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion; [2] food security and nutrition; [3]
shelter, settlement and non-food items; and [4] health action. There is also a series of

IASC Operational Guidelines on the Protection of Persons in Situations of
Natural Disasters promote and facilitate a rights-based approach to disaster relief.
In particular, they call on humanitarian actors to ensure that human rights principles
are integrated into all disaster response and recovery efforts, and that affected people
are fully consulted and can participate in all stages of disaster response. The IASC
published the Operational Guidelines in 2011. They are based on existing human rights
law and humanitarian accountability standards.
7
MSEE were established in 2004. They were distinguished as Sphere Companion Standards in 2008.
12INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement identify rights and guarantees
relevant to the protection of persons from forced displacement and to their protection
and assistance during displacement as well as during return or resettlement and
reintegration. They were established by the United Nations in 1998.
Oslo Guidelines on the Use of Foreign Military and Civil Defence Assets in
Disaster Relief address the use of foreign military and civil-defence assets (MCDA)
in international disaster relief operations. The guidelines highlight the principle that
use of foreign military and civil-defence assets should be requested only where there
is no comparable civilian alternative. They also provide principles and procedures for
requesting and coordinating military and civil-defence assets when these resources are
deemed necessary and appropriate for humanitarian response. A Consultative Group
on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets manages the Oslo Guidelines.
Asia-Pacific Regional Guidelines for the Use of Foreign Military Assets in Natural
Disaster Response Operations reinforce the principles of the Oslo Guidelines and
provide regional contexts for Asia and the Pacific. They were established in 2011 and
are the outcome of the Asia-Pacific Conferences on Military Assistance to Disaster
Relief Operations (APC-MADRO) in which 16 countries from across the Asia-Pacific
region participated.
Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters Field Manual is a technical guide
produced jointly by the ICRC, IFRC, Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and
WHO, which outlines the proper and dignified management of dead bodies after a
disaster. The manual covers a range of specific tasks related to the management of
dead bodies including infectious disease risks, body recovery, storage, identification,
and disposal of dead bodies. The Field Manual also includes a number of identification
and inventory forms among other useful resources.
Guidelines for Environmental Emergencies offer technical guidance to Governments
wishing to improve their preparedness frameworks for environmental emergencies and
for international environmental emergency responders providing assistance. They were
jointly developed by OCHA and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
and issued in 2009.
IASC Guidelines for Gender-Based Violence in Humanitarian Settings enable
Governments, humanitarian organizations, and communities to establish and
coordinate a set of minimum multi-sectoral interventions to prevent and respond to
gender-based violence during the early phase of an emergency. They were established
by the IASC in 2005.
IASC Gender Handbook in Humanitarian Action8 sets forth standards for the
integration of gender issues from the outset of an emergency so that humanitarian
services reach their target audience and have maximum impact. The Handbook was
published in 2006.
REMEMBER
States are always responsible for disaster response efforts on their
sovereign territories. External support for disaster response is only
triggered if a State’s national capacities are exceeded, and if it requests
and/or accepts international assistance.

A complete list of Guidances that have been approved by the IASC is available online here

Humanitarian actors
If a Government requests and/or accepts external assistance, a variety of international
humanitarian actors may be asked to support disaster response and disaster response
preparedness, including the UN, RCRC Movement, regional intergovernmental bodies,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), assisting Governments, and the private
sector.9 Below is a short description of these different categories of international
humanitarian actors.
How to read this section
Each category and sub-category of humanitarian actor includes a short
description of who it is and what it does, followed by a call-out highlighted
in green:
How does this entity work with Governments?
United Nations
UN Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies (UN Agencies) have their
membership, leadership and budget processes separate to those of the UN Secretariat,
but are committed to work with and through the established UN coordination
mechanisms and report to the UN Member States through their respective governing
boards. The UN agencies, most of which also have pre-existing development-focused
relationships with Member States, provide sector-specific support and expertise before,
during and after a disaster. The main UN agencies with humanitarian mandates include
FAO, IOM, OCHA, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UN-HABITAT, UNICEF, UN Women, WFP
and WHO, which support disaster response across needs, from shelter, protection,
food security, health, nutrition, education and livelihoods to common services like
coordination, logistics and telecommunications.
The senior UN official in a country is usually designated as the Resident Coordinator
(UN RC) – the primary focal point for a Government’s engagement with the UN system.
In some cases, the designation of Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) may also be given
to a UN official, making that person the primary focal point for interaction between
Government, UN and non-governmental actors working in the humanitarian field.
The UN has also established a number of interdependent coordination and response
mechanisms designed to support it in fulfilling its humanitarian responsibilities; these
are described in detail under the next section on coordination mechanisms.
How do UN organizations work with Governments?
At the country level, UN organizations work in partnership with NDMOs and
with respective Government line ministries.

Because the scope of the guide is limited to response and response preparedness, it is not possible for the Guide to fully
describe the significant community of regional and international intergovernmental organizations that work in disaster
mitigation and risk reduction; however, three among them merit mention here: UN International Strategy for Disaster
Reduction (UNISDR), Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC) and the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) of
the World Bank.
14INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
RCRC Movement
The RCRC Movement is the world’s largest humanitarian network, comprising nearly
100 million members, volunteers and supporters of 187 National Societies. Structurally,
the RCRC Movement comprises three core components:
1. 187 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
2. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)
3. International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
Together, these components operate worldwide with a mission to prevent and
alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found, to protect life and health, and
to ensure respect for the human being, particularly in times of armed conflict and
other emergencies. The RCRC Movement works in accordance with the fundamental
principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity
and universality.
National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (National Societies) occupy a
unique place as auxiliaries to the public authorities in their countries. They provide
disaster relief, support health and social programmes, and promote international
humanitarian law and humanitarian values.
How do National Societies work with Governments?
National societies are generally the first points of contact for Governments requesting
additional support from IFRC (in natural disasters) and ICRC (in situations of armed
conflict). National societies are not NGOs, and have a different relationship with
Governments and public authorities than registered NGOs. National Societies work
alongside national and local public authorities in disaster situations. In Asia and the
Pacific, 37 countries have a National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society.
What does the term “auxiliary role” mean?
It is a technical term to express the unique partnership a National Society has with its
Government in providing public humanitarian services. Although National Societies
work alongside Governments and public authorities, they are independent and their
work is not controlled or directed by the national Government. Each Government
must recognize its National Society as a legal entity and allow it to operate according
to the fundamental principles of the RCRC Movement.
International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)
coordinates and directs assistance in natural disasters in support of the National
Society. IFRC and its National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also undertake
activities including preparedness, response and development work, including disaster
preparedness, emergency health, disaster law, water and sanitation, and humanitarian
diplomacy. The IFRC Asia Pacific Regional Office is in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
15INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
How does IFRC work with Governments?
IFRC interfaces with Governments directly and through the 187-member National
Societies.
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral and
independent organization mandated to protect the lives and dignity of victims of war
and other situations of violence and provide them with assistance. During armed conflict,
ICRC is responsible for directing and coordinating the RCRC Movement’s international
relief activities. ICRC promotes the importance of International Humanitarian Law and
draws attention to universal humanitarian principles. ICRC has been granted observer
status to the UN General Assembly. Its headquarters are in Geneva and it has country
and regional offices throughout Asia and the Pacific.
How does ICRC work with Governments?
In a conflict-affected country, ICRC and that country’s National Society pool their
operational resources to support victims of war and other situations of violence.
Regional intergovernmental organizations and
forums
The Asia-Pacific region comprises many intergovernmental organizations that offer an
array of humanitarian tools and services to Member States and participating states.
Several regional intergovernmental organizations and forums active in emergency
preparedness and response are described here:
1. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the ASEAN Coordinating
Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) and
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
2. South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation
3. Pacific Islands Forum10
4. Secretariat of the Pacific Community11
5. East Asia Summit
6. Asia Pacific Economic Community
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) established the ASEAN Committee
on Disaster Management (ACDM) in 200312 which assumes overall responsibility
for coordinating and implementing regional disaster management activities for the
10 ASEAN Member States. It consists of the heads of NDMOs of all ASEAN member
countries. As part of it objective in pursuing an ASEAN region of disaster-resilient

PIF members are Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau,
Papua New Guinea, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. In addition to SPC and
PIF, Pacific Island countries are also networked through the secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP),
which focuses on climate change and resource sustainability.
11
SPC membership comprises the PIF nations plus the territories of American Samoa, French Polynesia, Guam, New
Caledonia, Northern Mariana Islands, Pitcairn Islands, Tokelau and Wallis and Futuna, as well as France and the United States
of America.

countries and safer communities, it adopted the AADMER in 2005. It now provides
policy oversight and supervision in the implementation process of the AADMER Work
Programme.
How does the ASEAN ACDM work with ASEAN Governments?
The ASEAN ACDM is made up of NDMOs from all 10 ASEAN member states. ACDM
members are also the AADMER National Focal Points. The ACDM reports to the
Conference of Parties composed of ministers in charge of disaster management.
Established in 2011, the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance
on disaster management (AHA Centre) is responsible for the operational
coordination of all activities envisaged under the AADMER. The AHA Centre facilitates
co-operation and co-ordination among the ASEAN Member States, and with relevant
United Nations and International organizations, in promoting regional collaboration.
AHA Centre offers a range of tools and services, including trainings and capacity-
building of ASEAN NDMOs and deployment of emergency response teams.
ASEAN Disaster Monitoring and Response System (DMRS) and the ASEAN Disaster
Information Network (ADInet) provide monitoring services and disaster information to
NDMOs through web-based facilities. The AHA Centre also manages an inter-agency
partnership framework between ASEAN and seven major international NGOs13, called
the AADMER Partnership Group (APG) to promote a civil-society approach to the
implementation of the AADMER. The Secretariat of AHA Centre is located in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
How does the AHA Centre work with Governments?
The AHA Centre is the first point of contact for ASEAN states in the event of a disaster.
The AHA Centre is governed by NDMO representatives from all 10 ASEAN member
states in their capacity as ACDM representatives and ASEAN National Focal Points.
With a membership that extends beyond the 10 ASEAN members to include 26
countries (and the European Union), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a broad-
based political and security cooperation platform to foster constructive dialogue on
issues of common interest. It also contributes to confidence-building and preventive
diplomacy in the region. In addition to the 10 ASEAN nations, current members include
Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,
the European Union, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste and the United States.
How does ARF work with Governments?
The ARF provides a platform for dialogue through a series of annual meetings. The
most senior of these is held annually at the Foreign Minister level in June in conjunction
with the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference.14
13
Participating NGOs include Global Movement for Children, Help Age, Mercy Malaysia, Oxfam, Plan International, Save the
Children, and World Vision.
14
To support this two ARF Senior Officials Meetings are held annually in May/June. These in turn are informed by two
ARF Inter-Sessional Support Group Meetings (ISG) on Confidence Building Measures and Preventative Diplomacy and by
four Inter-Sessional Meetings (ISM) on Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime, Disaster Relief, Maritime Security, and
Nonproliferation and Disarmament.
17INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) adopted the SAARC
Comprehensive Framework on Disaster Management in 2006, establishing the SAARC
Disaster Management Centre (SMDC). SDMC’s mandate is to establish and strengthen
the South Asia regional disaster management system as a tool to reduce risks and
improve response and recovery. SDMC is envisaged to function under the auspices of
the SAARC NDRRM treaty to improve and maintain regional standby arrangements,
among other cooperative mechanisms, for disaster relief and emergency response.
SDMC is located at the SAARC secretariat in New Delhi.
How does SAARC SDMC work with Governments?
It does this through national focal points of member countries, and with ministries,
departments and associations within Governments.
Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is an international organization established by treaty
with 16 Member States across the Pacific region. PIF is mandated to strengthen
regional coordination and integration through policy advice to and support for the
implementation of the PIF leader’s decisions under the auspices of a strategic framework
called the Pacific Plan. The PIF secretariat is in Suva, Fiji.
How does PIF work with Governments?
PIF holds an annual meeting followed by a number of post-forum dialogues with key
Government partners during the year to discuss aspects of the Pacific Plan which can
include disaster response and disaster response preparedness.
Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) supports the 22 Pacific Island countries
and territories to address the risks posed by climate vulnerability and natural disasters.
SPC is engaged in all sciences concerned with the Earth, including geological, physical,
chemical and biological processes. The SPC organizes its work according to three
technical programme areas: oceans and islands; water and sanitation; and disaster
reduction. Its headquarters are in Suva, Fiji.
How does SPC work with Governments?
Pacific Island member countries receive basic geological knowledge in support of
disaster response preparedness capabilities from SPC. SPC is not involved in disaster
response.
East Asia Summit (EAS) is a regional forum for dialogue on broad strategic, political
and economic issues of common interest and concern. It brings together the leaders of
the 10 ASEAN Member States, as well as Australia, China, Japan, India, Korea, Russian
Federation and the United States. Disaster response and humanitarian assistance are
among the wide range of regional concerns covered by the EAS agenda. In 2012, India
hosted the first EAS meeting specifically addressing disaster risk management.
18INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
How does EAS work with Governments?
Held at the Head of State level, EAS meetings are organized each year following the
annual ASEAN leaders’ meeting. The specific framework by which countries will gather
to discuss disaster management issues has not yet established, but a proposal by the
Governments of Australia and Indonesia would create a coordination framework
through an expanded ACDM membership.

Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a forum of 21 Pacific Rim economies
that seeks to promote free trade and economic cooperation. APEC comprises an
Emergency Preparedness Working Group (EPWG) mandated to coordinate and facilitate
emergency and disaster preparedness within APEC. EPWG is focused on reducing the
risk of disasters, and building business and community resilience through knowledge
sharing and collaboration among its 21 member economies. EPWG has developed a
Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction and Emergency Preparedness and Response in the
Asia-Pacific Region 2009-2015, which guides its activities in this area.
How does APEC EPWG work with Governments?
APEC EPWG is co-chaired by two member economies for two years. The working
group meets once a year with the heads of emergency management agencies and
holds additional workshops as required.
Non-governmental organizations
15
Civil-society actors can be divided into two categories: national and community-based
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international NGOs. In addition to their
independent relationships with Governments, NGOs assemble themselves according
to networks and consortia on global, regional and country levels.
National and community-based NGOs are civil-society organizations that function
within national borders only. These NGOs work independently to support the
emergency preparedness and response activities of Governments, UN agencies and
larger international NGOs. They generally possess strong community-based networks
critical to reaching disaster-affected communities. National NGOs can be either secular
or faith based entities.
In Asia and the Pacific, 48 national NGOs from 18 countries participate in a consortium
called the Asian Disaster Reduction and Response Network (ADRRN). ADRRN aims to
promote coordination and information sharing among NGOs and other stakeholders
for effective disaster reduction and response.
How do national and community-based NGOs work with Governments?
National NGOs are officially registered as national organizations with host Governments.
National NGOs, sometimes with international NGOs, organize themselves according to
consortia that interface with Governments on sector-specific bases.
International NGOs operating in emergency preparedness and response include
humanitarian organizations and multi-mandated organizations that operate
independently to provide humanitarian assistance. The largest international NGOs,
in terms of annual expenditure, are generally based in North America and Europe,
with regional and country offices across Asia and the Pacific and other parts of the
world16. There is also a growing number of NGOs based in Asia and the Pacific with

According to ALNAP, the five largest international NGOs, measured by expenditure on humanitarian programming in 2010,
were Médecins sans Frontières, Catholic Relief Services, Oxfam International, the International Save the Children Alliance, and
World Vision International.
20INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
programmes of international reach. International NGOs can also be either secular or
faith-based. International NGOs receive regular funding from donor Governments,
private foundations and corporations, but a growing proportion of their resources
comes from the general public in their countries of origin and countries of operation.
International NGOs are represented at global coordination platforms by consortia
such as the International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA), Steering Committee
for Humanitarian Response (SCHR) and InterAction. Other consortia can be formed
to address global NGO priorities; for example, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Mercy
Corps, Oxfam, Save the Children, International Rescue Committee and World Vision
participate in a global initiative called the Emergency Capacity-Building (ECB) Project.
which focuses on developing national staff skills, facilitating collaboration and
creating practical tools and approaches to disaster preparedness and risk reduction
programming.17
How do international NGOs work with Governments?
The presence of international NGOs in host countries is facilitated by an official
registration with the host Government, and guided by individual memorandums
of understanding with NDMOs and line ministries engaged in humanitarian and
development activities.
Assisting Governments
Assisting (donor) Governments are central to disaster response. Governments can
assist in international disaster response by giving assistance through direct bilateral
contributions to affected States, including through the mobilization of of in-kind aid
of MCDA. They can also channel funding through multilateral agencies such as UN
agencies, Regional Organizations, the RCRC Movement, or NGOs. There are a number
of Governments that routinely respond to the needs of disaster-affected states, both
from within the Asia and the Pacific region as well as from Europe and the Americas.
How do assisting Governments work with affected Governments?
Many assisting (donor) Governments have established aid cooperation structures, often
embedded in their respective Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The day-to-day management
of the cooperation takes place through the embassies in the affected countries.
Private sector
Private sector companies are increasingly involved in disaster response, often as part of
their commitment to a corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. This involvement
can take many forms, including as donors to the UN, Red Cross Red Crescent Societies,
and NGOs, and as direct service providers of aid. Companies like DHL and Ericsson
have been working to support humanitarian logistics and telecommunications for
years and are being joined by a growing number of private sector actors now involved
in disaster response. The vast majority of private companies’ involvement in disaster
relief occurs independently.
17
The ECB partnership is implemented by inter-agency consortium in four countries, two of which are in the Asia-Pacific
region. The four countries of the ECB are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Bolivia and Niger. ECB can be accessed through one of its
participating organizations or through the contact information on its website.
21INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
How does the private sector work with Governments?
Governments may be approached by private sector companies that wish to offer
assistance and should examine those offers on their own merits. The modalities for
private sector assistance are varied and it may be convenient to reach out to a broader
spectrum of companies interested in contributing to disaster relief through the national
or local level Chamber of Commerce (or equivalent).
International coordination mechanisms
Effective disaster response requires careful coordination at global, regional and
national levels. As noted above, the UN has established a number of interdependent
coordination mechanisms designed to guide relations among humanitarian actors and
between humanitarian actors, Governments and disaster-affected people to ensure
the delivery of coherent and principled assistance.
This section of the guide describes the structure and operating protocols of the principal
international coordination framework, with details on how the component mechanisms
work during both the disaster response and disaster response preparedness phases.
It also offers clear information about how these coordination mechanisms interrelate
with one another and how they work with Governments. The mechanisms presented
include:
1. Emergency Relief Coordinator
2. Inter-Agency Standing Committee
3. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinators
4. Humanitarian Country Team
5. Cluster Approach
6. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
Global level mechanisms
Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) is the most senior UN official dealing
with humanitarian affairs, mandated by the UN General Assembly to coordinate
international humanitarian assistance during emergency response, whether carried
out by governmental, intergovernmental or non-governmental organizations. S/he
reports directly to the UN Secretary-General, with specific responsibility for processing
Members States’ requests and coordinating humanitarian assistance; ensuring
information management and sharing to support early warning and response;
facilitating access to emergency areas; organizing needs assessments, preparing joint
appeals, and mobilizing resources to support humanitarian response; and supporting
a smooth transition from relief to recovery operations.
How does the ERC work with Governments?
The ERC is responsible for the oversight of all emergencies requiring international
humanitarian assistance and supervises the actions of country-level UN RCs and HCs.
S/he also plays a central role in advocacy and fundraising for humanitarian action.

Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) is chaired by the ERC. It is an inter-agency
forum for coordination, policy development and decision-making involving key UN
and non-UN humanitarian partners. IASC members are FAO, OCHA, UNDP, UNFPA,
UN-HABITAT, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. IASC Standing Invitees are ICRC, the
International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA), IFRC, InterAction, International
Organization for Migration (IOM), Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR), Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response (SCHR), Office of the Special

Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons and the World Bank.
The IASC continuously seeks to improve the effectiveness of the humanitarian system
as a whole. It is currently engaged in implementing changes to improve how the
international humanitarian system particularly in the areas of effective coordination,
better accountability and a strengthened leadership, through the so-called IASC
“Transformative Agenda.”
How does the IASC work with Governments?
The IASC and its subsidiary bodies are global mechanisms. At the country level,
Humanitarian Country Teams (HCTs) fulfill a similar function and have similar
membership to the IASC among humanitarian organizations resident or working in
the host country.

Country level mechanisms
UN Resident Coordinator (UN RC) is the designated representative of the UN
Secretary-General in a particular country and leader of the UN Country Team (UNCT).
The UN RC function is usually performed by the UNDP Resident Representative.
S/he is accredited by letter from the UN Secretary-General to the Head of State or
Government.
Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) is appointed by the ERC, in consultation with the
IASC, when large-scale and/or sustained international humanitarian assistance is
required in a country. The decision to assign an HC to a country is often made at the
start of a crisis and in consultation with the affected Government. In some cases,
the ERC may choose to designate the UN RC as the HC, in others another Head of
Agency (UN and/or INGO participating in the coordinated response system) may be
*Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the on the human rights of internally displaced persons
24INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
appointed and/or a stand-alone HC may be deployed from the pre-selected pool of
HC candidates. The HC assumes the leadership of the HCT in a crisis. In the absence
of an HC, the UN RC is responsible for the strategic and operational coordination of
response efforts of UNCT member agencies and other relevant humanitarian actors.
How does the RC and/or HC work with Governments?
The UN RC is the senior UN official in a country and the Government’s first point
of contact with the United Nations. The RC is responsible for coordination of all UN
operational activities, and chairs the UNCT. Where appointed, however, the HC assumes
leadership on humanitarian response and supports the coordination of all relevant
humanitarian organizations (UN and non-UN). The HC is then the Government’s first
point of contact on disaster response. In a humanitarian situation where no HC has
been appointed, the UN RC remains the Government’s first point of contact and may
Chair a humanitarian country team as well as the UNCT.
Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) is an in-country decision-making forum focused
on providing common strategic and policy guidance on issues related to humanitarian
action. HCT membership generally mirrors that of the IASC at country level, composed
of UN and non-UN humanitarian organizations resident and/or working in the country.
The HC is chaired by the HC, or in the absence of an HC, by the UN RC. Subject to
their individual mandates, the components of the RCRC Movement may participate
in an HCT. Some HCTs have also decided to include representatives of key assisting
Governments in their membership.
How does an HCT work with Governments?
An HCT’s primary function is to provide strategic and policy guidance to humanitarian
actors; however, it can also serve as a senior-level central point of interface for
Governments.
Pacific Humanitarian Team - adapting the HCT in the
Pacific region
The Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) is a specialized HCT in the South Pacific
covering 14 Pacific Island countries. These are also the countries covered by UN
RCs and UNCTs based in Fiji and Samoa. The objective of the PHT is to support
the Governments of the Pacific to prepare for, and mount a timely, consistent
and coordinated response. The PHT has been endorsed as a coordinating body by
the IASC and is itself organized through regional clusters in support of national
coordination mechanisms.
"Bridging" mechanisms
Clusters are the IASC-managed organizational groupings of operational agencies,
both UN and non-UN, in each of the main sectors of humanitarian action. Clusters
operate at the global and country levels to support national Governments in managing
international assistance.
At the global level, clusters are responsible for strengthening system-wide preparedness
and coordinating technical capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies in their
25INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
International coordination mechanisms: some
useful distinctions
1. HC vs. RC
The HC supports coordination of humanitarian operations among all international
actors - UN and non-UN. The RC supports coordination of development
operations among UN actors only.
2. HCT vs. UNCT
Whereas the UNCT includes the heads of all UN agencies plus IOM, the HCT
comprises only heads of the UN’s humanitarian agencies, as well as non-UN
humanitarian actors (i.e. NGOs and the RCRC Movement). The UNCT focuses on
the UN’s support for national development programmes, while the HCT addresses
strategic issues of the wider humanitarian community.
Note: Like the HC and RC functions, the UNCT and HCT coexist; they do not
replace each other. The RC or HC is responsible for ensuring complementarity
between the two entities.
3. HCT vs. Clusters
The HCT provides strategic and policy guidance to the overall response effort,
whereas country-level clusters implement the strategy by coordinating operational
response efforts in their respective areas of expertise. Country cluster lead
agencies are members of the HCT.
respective sectors. At the country level, clusters ensure that humanitarian organizations’
activities are coordinated and serve as a first point of call for the Government, the UN
RC and the HC. To the extent possible, clusters mirror national response structures18 ,
use terminology that is close or identical to that of the national sectors, and are co-
chaired by Government representatives. Where required, country-level clusters can be
established at the onset of a disaster and may or may not remain following the initial
phases of response based on in-country assessment of continued need.
Globally, nine clusters have been established with designated Cluster Leads Agencies
that are accountable to the IASC. At the country level, the clusters are led by country-
level representatives accountable to the UN RC or the HC. However, cluster lead
agencies at the country level need not be the same agency as the sector’s Global
Cluster Lead. Instead, cluster leadership should be based on the local context and
capacities of agencies already on the ground. The structure of clusters at the country
level should also be adapted to local needs. Similarly, sub-national clusters may be
established where required, and once again, the local cluster leads need not be the
same as those designated at country level. Uniquely in the Pacific, the PHT is a regional
cluster arrangement that supports national coordination arrangements.
How do clusters work with Governments?
In-country clusters support the response needs of Governments through hand-in-hand
support to line ministries. In-country clusters are accessed through the HC, the HCT
or Cluster Lead organizations. Regional and global cluster work is accessed through
OCHA-ROAP at ocha-roap@un.org
18
Some clusters that are established to coordinate common services such as logistics and emergency telecommunications may
not have national counterparts to complement.
26INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
In the Asia-Pacific Region, clusters and cluster-like structures are currently active in
Bangladesh, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Indonesia, Lao PDR,
Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.

Do clusters always look the same in every country?
There is wide diversity in how clusters are activated and de-activated at country
levels. The Guidance Note on Using the Cluster Approach to Strengthen
Humanitarian Response exists, but does not call for activation of clusters in every
instance. In certain emergency situations, only some clusters are activated; others,
additional sub-clusters are required to address the breadth of coordination needs.
While UN and NGOs are designated as cluster leads at the global level, clusters may
be led by other organizations, including Government entities, at the country and
local levels.
Country-level clusters are generally activated for the first time in emergency
situations, but clusters can exist in varying forms before, during and after a disaster.
For example, in the Philippines, clusters were introduced to respond to large-scale
floods in 2006. However, due to recurrent disasters in the country and a resurgence
of armed conflict in Mindanao in 2008, the Government was encouraged to
institutionalize the coordination approach via a national decree. As a result, clusters
are now a permanent coordination mechanism in the country, managed by the
National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (NDRRM) Council. The NDRRM
Council is composed of Government line ministries, but will soon include five
national NGOs and the Philippines Red Cross National Society. Representatives of
Government entities function as the cluster leads in the country.19

Please see earlier text box on the unique regional cluster coordination mechanism for the Pacific.
28INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ARCHITECTURE
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is an Office of
the UN Secretariat that provides institutional support to the ERC at the global level
and UN RCs and HCs at country level to coordinate humanitarian action, advocate
for the rights of people in need, develop humanitarian policy and analysis, manage
humanitarian information systems and oversee humanitarian pooled funds. OCHA is
headquartered in Geneva and New York with a strong presence at the regional and
country levels in Asia and the Pacific:
1. OCHA Regional Office in Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) is located in Bangkok.
It provides support to 36 countries in South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia and
the Pacific.
2. OCHA Regional Office for the Pacific (ROP) is based in Fiji. It supports 14
Pacific Island countries under the leadership of two UN RCs in Fiji and Samoa. In
addition, it provides support to the PHT.
3. OCHA maintains Country Offices in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Indonesia, Pakistan
and the Philippines, providing support to the Humanitarian Coordinators and the
local HCTs.
4. Humanitarian Advisory Teams (HATs) are small OCHA presences in support
of Resident and Humanitarian Coordinators, and are located in Nepal, Bangladesh
and Japan.
How does OCHA work with Governments?
UN RCs and HCs are a Government’s first point of contact with the international
humanitarian system. OCHA typically supports UN RCs through its regional offices and
HCs through a country office or, in some cases, through a HAT. Increasingly, OCHA
also works directly with relevant Government counterparts, particularly NDMOs, to
provide support to government-led emergency coordination, preparedness activities,
and/or capacity building. OCHA also provides support to regional organizations that
have humanitarian mandates.
REMEMBER
The coordination mechanisms described here are more effective in a
previously arranged coordinated context. Therefore, Governments are
encouraged to contact potential partners before the onset of an
emergency.
